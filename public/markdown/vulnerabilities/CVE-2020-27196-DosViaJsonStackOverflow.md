# DoS via JSON parse Stack Overflow

## CVE-ID

CVE-2020-27196

## Date

1 October 2020

## Description

Play body parsing of HTTP requests eagerly parses a payload given a `Content-Type` header. A deep JSON structure sent to a valid POST endpoint (that may or may not expect JSON payloads) causes a `StackOverflowError`.

## Impact

This only impacts Play applications implemented using the `PlayJava` flavor.

## Affected versions

- Play 2.8.0-2.8.2
- Play 2.7.0-2.7.5
- Play 2.6.x

## Fixes

This issue is fixed on Play 2.8.3 and 2.7.6. There wonâ€™t be a 2.6.x release with this fix since this version has reached end-of-support, please upgrade as soon as possible to avoid this security issue.
